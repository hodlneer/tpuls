                <p> The major tourist destinations in Europe are packed this summer, so there’s not many options for a last-minute vacation. With that in mind, plan two to three months out in order to secure hotels in the best locations. Waiting until just a few weeks out will result in little to no choice in accommodations.</p>
                <p>Likewise, don’t plan on showing up to the popular museum or monument without reservations. Doing so will result in a several-hour wait, or worse, tickets being completely sold out. A little advance planning this summer will save you from a lot of disappointment</p>

                    <p class="ps-6">There have been a lot of reports of services falling through in Europe this summer. Car services that don’t turn up, or hotels that are overbooked and moving reservations at the last minute. It’s not ideal, but if you have a backup plan you’ll be able to go with the flow and minimize the stress of being served an unwelcome surprise.</p>

                 <p>If you know going into your trip that there will be kinks, you’ll be better able to handle them. Arrive at least 3 hours early at the airport. There will be long lines to check bags and get through security. Don’t be surprised if your flight is delayed a bit.</p>

                <p>Do you have a connecting flight? Plan to have at least two hours in between your connection. That way you won’t be forced to run through the airport only to have the gangway closed in your face. Arriving in Europe you’ll need to go through customs at your first airport, which means more long lines. Allowing yourself enough time between your flights will alleviate any stress of missing your connection.</p>

                <p>And if you do happen to miss your connection? Take a deep breath, go right to the closest customer service desk, and ask to be put on the next flight out. The agents there are pros at this and will be able to see all available options. But don’t just rely on them – while you’re waiting in line, pull up your airline’s app and try to chat with an agent there to see if they can’t help you first. After you’re scheduled on your next flight, grab a coffee, do some stretches, and go check out the shops in your terminal – you might as well make an adventure of the next few hours.</p>

                    Reaching the seven million visitor threshold will bring Dominican Republic travel within close proximity of its pre-pandemic high-water mark of 6.4 million land-based travelers and 1.1 million cruise ship visitors in 2019, according to Caribbean Tourism Organization data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only the Bahamas approached the Dominican Republic’s 7.5 million land-based and cruise-ship visitors in 2019. The Bahamas archipelago welcomed 6.5 million total visitors (including 5.4 million cruise ship travelers) that year.

                    The Dominican Republic’s tourism rebound is supported by recent OTA data.
