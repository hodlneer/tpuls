      <p>Reaching the seven million visitor threshold will bring Dominican Republic travel within close proximity of its pre-pandemic high-water mark of 6.4 million land-based travelers and 1.1 million cruise ship visitors in 2019, according to Caribbean Tourism Organization data.</p>
<p>Only the Bahamas approached the Dominican Republic’s 7.5 million land-based and cruise-ship visitors in 2019. The Bahamas archipelago welcomed 6.5 million total visitors (including 5.4 million cruise ship travelers) that year.</p>
<p>The Dominican Republic’s tourism rebound is supported by recent OTA data. In May, Expedia Group reported Dominican Republic summer stays grew 40 percent year-over-year compared with 2021. International travelers drove this year’s increase, led by the U.S., the primary Dominican travel audience, representing 80 percent of visitors.</p>
<p>Expedia’s report adds year-over-year Caribbean searches rebounded during this year’s second quarter. Punta Cana topped the list at 150 percent growth, followed by Cancun at 45 percent said Freddy Domínguez, Expedia’s vice president for Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>

<p>Collado said new resorts are planned for Punta Cana, including a $175 million Secrets Tides Punta Cana Resort & Spa. “There are multiple projects in Punta Cana that continue to consolidate the destination,” he said.</p>
<p>Resort investment is also planned for Puerto Plata and Pedernales in the south of the country, with additional rooms in the Samaná district, Collado said. Meanwhile, the country will continue expanding its cruise facilities with an eye toward attracting more seagoing visitors.
“We have had a great boom in terms of cruises and we intend to continue expanding,” said Jean Luis Rodríguez, executive director of Apordom, the Dominican port authority.
